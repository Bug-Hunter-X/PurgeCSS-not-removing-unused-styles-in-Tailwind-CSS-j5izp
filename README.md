# PurgeCSS issue with Tailwind CSS
This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using PurgeCSS with Tailwind CSS.  Despite correctly configuring PurgeCSS, unused styles are not being removed from the final CSS output.

## Bug Description
The issue lies in how PurgeCSS is interacting with the Tailwind CSS configuration and the structure of the project.  Even with seemingly correct configuration, PurgeCSS fails to identify and remove unused styles, leading to larger-than-necessary CSS files.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the build process (instructions specific to your project setup may be needed).
4. Observe the generated CSS file.  You will notice unused styles that should have been removed by PurgeCSS. 

## Expected Behavior
PurgeCSS should remove all unused Tailwind CSS styles.

## Actual Behavior
Unused styles remain in the generated CSS file. 

## Solution (bugSolution.js)
This may require adjusting the PurgeCSS configuration file or reviewing your Tailwind directives within the components used.
